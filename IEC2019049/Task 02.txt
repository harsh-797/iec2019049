Hi!
Myself Harshit Sinha(IEC2019049)
The wings of GeekHaven that I'm interested in are:
1-Competitive Coding-I find cc similar to what i've been doing past 2 years(JEE Prep),i.e. finding out a solution to a problem which takes the minimum time to get the result.Moreover, some of the seniors' have inspired me a lot.

2-WebD and AppD-Developing something has always been in my interest.I get to learn a lot of new things in development.moreover,i will love to make somethings that can be used by the people around me.
